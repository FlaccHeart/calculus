# vmath
Advanced Math C++ Library

* This software is provided without any express or implied warranty.

This library provides some basic classes and functions for simple mathematical computations.
Originally, it was created for a personal use an also just in practice purposes.
There might be some minor (or major) issues, so be careful.

* In this version:

vm::mat - matrix class,

vm::vec - vector class,

vm::complex - complex number class.

There is also an interpolation function which uses Newton's formula,
a function for creating Sn group of transpositions and some other simple functions.
So if you still dare to use it, you would probably want to check vmath.h to see what there is.
